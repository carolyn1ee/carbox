Run the realOptimizer.py file. Currently only optimizes on 3 simulation points.

To create roads, click to begin a road and then use arrow keys to grow the road. Press enter when done drawing the road. If you want a particular road to have particular speed limit or rate for the cars to come in from off screen, put that number in the appropriate box and press the button before drawing that road. For speed, it should be between 1 and 20...

Then click the "done drawing roads" button to go to the next simulation. Please wait a good amount of time to let some cars go through the simulation before moving onto the next simulation. 

Project description:
Traffic light simulator: simulates cars going through intersection and finds optimal timing for the lights. Optimal timing will minimize values such as the average amount of time spent waiting at an intersection and the number of cars stopped at an intersection. User can add in new intersections that connect to preexisting intersections. Additionally, after running many simulations, it shows how much time on average was spent at an intersection waiting for a green light and the max number of cars backed up in the best set of timings which minimized these two factors.
