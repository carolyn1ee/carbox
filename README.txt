Run the realOptimizer.py file. Currently only optimizes on 3 simulation points.

To create roads, click to begin a road and then use arrow keys to grow the road. Press enter when done. 

Traffic light simulator: simulates cars going through intersection and finds optimal timing for the lights. Optimal timing will minimizes the average amount of time spent waiting at an intersection. User can add in new intersections that connect to preexisting intersections. Additionally, after running many simulations, the program will show a simulation of the best simulation with the timing for the minimal light timings.
